# DCEL Cuts

This library enables "gridless" allocations of 2D space.

It does this via an integer bound doubly connected edge list structure with supplied geometric boolean and graph edit operations.

Simply put, you can divide space into irregular polygons as you like.

# Testing

Test cases are supplied, gtest is not.
